# OpenGL Farm 3D Graphic Design
This project is a 3D graphic design of a farm created using the OpenGL library. It features various objects including a sheep, a water trough, and a hay bale. The purpose of this project is to showcase the capabilities of OpenGL in creating interactive and visually appealing 3D scenes.

This project was created as part of a university assignment and will not be updated further. It serves as a demonstration of OpenGL concepts and techniques.
